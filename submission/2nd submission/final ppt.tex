\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    A face detector has to tell whether an image of arbitrary size contains a human face and if so, where it is.
  }
  \item {
    One natural framework for considering this problem is that of binary classification, in which a classifier is constructed to minimize the min classification risk.
  }
  \item{
  The algorithm must minimize both the false negative and false positive rates in order to achieve an acceptable performance.
  }
  \item{
  The challenges associated with face detection are:Pose,Presence or absence of structural component,Facial expression,Occlusion,Image orientation,Imaging conditions
  }
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Methods}
Face Detection methods can be classified in two approaches
\begin{itemize}
\item Featured based Approach
\item Image Based Approach
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Featured based Approach}

\begin{itemize}
\item Edges
\item Gray-Level
\item Color
\item Motion
\item Feature searching
\item Snakes
\item Deformable Templates
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Image Based Approach}
Neural Networks


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label=main]
\frametitle{Viola Jones Face Detection Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Haar Features:-Haar features are used to detect the presence of particular feature in the given image. Each features resulting a single value which is calculated by
subtracting the sum of pixels under white rectangle from the sum of pixel under black rectangle.

\item Integral Image:-Rectangle features can be computed very rapidly using an intermediate representation for the image which we call the integral image.

\item Adaboost:-Adaboost is machine learning algorithm which helps in finding only the best features among all.

\item Cascading:-Images with multiple faces would suffer from multiple false alarming of face detected. Cascading helps to remove non-face sub-windows to increase detection rate.

\end{itemize}
